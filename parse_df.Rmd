When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Purpose: to determine 
```{r}
eventsdescrp_df<-read.csv("sample_eventsdescrp_df.csv")
eventsdescrp_df$Description<-as.character(eventsdescrp_df$Description)
```

idea: use group by person id, group by case number, call function 
```{r}
fail_to_appear<-eventsdescrp_df%>%
                  mutate(fail_appeared=if_else(str_detect(Description,coll("Withdrawn",T,ignore_case=T))
                                               ==T,1,0)) %>%
                  select(person_id,EventDate,case_num,fail_appeared)
View(fail_to_appear)
#string<-eventsdescrp_df$Description[1]
#if_else(str_detect(string,coll("Withdrawn",T,ignore_case=T))==T,1,0)
```


```{r}
#write.csv(fail_to_appear,"fail_to_appear.csv")
```
